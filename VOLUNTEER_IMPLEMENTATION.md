### Technology Stack
- **React Native** with Expo Router for navigation
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Native Paper** for Material Design components
- **AsyncStorage** for offline data persistence
- **Expo Notifications** for real-time push notifications
- **React Native Maps** integration for navigation
- **Custom hooks** for state management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```json
{
  "expo-notifications": "~0.30.10",
  "@react-native-community/datetimepicker": "8.4.1",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "2.2.0",
  "react-native-paper": "^5.14.5"
}
```

### Installation
The volunteer functionality is fully integrated with the existing FoodLink app. When users select "Volunteer" role:

1. They see the updated welcome screen with volunteer-specific features
2. "Get Started" navigates to `/volunteer/dashboard`
3. All volunteer screens are available in the navigation stack

### Usage Flow
1. **Role Selection** → Select "Volunteer" role
2. **Welcome Screen** → Review features and tap "Get Started"
3. **Dashboard** → View tasks, stats, and notifications
4. **Task Management** → Accept, start, and complete tasks
5. **Schedule View** → See calendar with all scheduled tasks
6. **Completed Tasks** → View history and achievements

## 📊 Data Models

### VolunteerTask
```typescript
interface VolunteerTask {
  id: string;
  donorInfo: {
    name: string;
    address: string;
    phone: string;
    contactPerson: string;
  };
  ngoInfo: {
    name: string;
    address: string;
    phone: string;
    contactPerson: string;
  };
  foodDetails: {
    type: string;
    quantity: string;
    expiryTime: string;
    specialInstructions?: string;
  };
  pickupTime: string;
  deliveryTime: string;
  status: 'assigned' | 'accepted' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  distance?: string;
  estimatedDuration?: string;
}
```

### VolunteerStats
```typescript
interface VolunteerStats {
  completedTasks: number;
  totalDeliveries: number;
  mealsDelivered: number;
  averageRating: number;
  totalHours: number;
  impactScore: number;
}
```
